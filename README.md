# SimCLR for Aircraft Radio Communications

This repository contains an implementation of SimCLR, a semi-supervised learning technique,
applied to a unique dataset of VHF communication between aircraft pilots.
The dataset was collected using a Raspberry Pi and a Flightware SDR,
with a GNU Radio model developed for this project.

# Dataset
The dataset is not publicly available, as it was specifically collected for this project.
It consists of a collection of VHF communication between aircraft pilots,
and was preprocessed using mel-spectogram to create the inputs to the CNN.

# Dataset
The performance of the SimCLR model on the aircraft radio communication dataset was
compared to using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The results of these evaluations are provided in the results.txt file.
